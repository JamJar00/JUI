# JUI
A C UI library for the LaFortuna board.

# Features
JUI is a simple to use user interface framework that provides 3 different menu types:
* Icon menu - Designed off the Blackberry phone homescreens.
* List view - Designed off the submenus in Blackberry phones.
* Grid view - A more generic grid layout manager based of Java's GridLayout.

JUI allows for a number components to be added to the views including:
* Buttons - Provide callbacks when selected.
* Text - Simple label components.
* Images - Hold images loaded form the SD card. (Not working as SD cards on the LaFortuna are too tempermental!)

Each component can be additionally provided a style that affects the position, precense and colour of the individual borders and background.
